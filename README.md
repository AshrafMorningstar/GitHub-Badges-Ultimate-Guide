  }
};
```

### **Badge Economics & Rarity Markets**
```
💰 Understanding Badge Value:

Scarcity Factors:
1. Time-limited availability
2. High skill requirements  
3. Historical significance
4. GitHub promotion level

Social Capital:
• Recognition within dev communities
• Resume/CV differentiation
• Open source credibility signals
• Conversation starters in interviews
```

## 🧪 **Experimental & Edge Cases**

### **Badge Interaction Effects**
```
🔬 Research Findings:

Synergy Effects:
• "Quickdraw" + active PR reviewing → faster "Pull Shark"
• "Galaxy Brain" answers → community trust → easier co-authorship

Diminishing Returns:
• After 50 PRs, additional "Pull Shark" progress slows
• Seasonal badge timing windows create annual cycles
```
